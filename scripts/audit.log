[2025-12-26 18:46:05] [FAIL] AI QA Result: FAIL - The content describes an activity observed until 'November 2024' but cites a source URL dated '2025/12'. This constitutes a factual inconsistency/hallucination as the article is referencing a source that, by its own date, has not yet been published relative to the described observation period. No grammatical errors were found, and the tone is professional.

[2025-12-27 17:22:43] [START] Starting Content QA for: 'Phishing Attacks using AI or normal techniques how to be safe/alert'...
[2025-12-27 17:22:51] [FAIL] AI QA Result: FAIL - The content fails on multiple critical checks. Style is not direct; it starts with a cliché, 'In our increasingly digital world,' which is equivalent to 'In the ever-evolving landscape...' and specifically rejected. Authenticity is compromised by this corporate fluff and by providing generic advice rather than raw, industry-specific insights. Terminology is too high-level; it lacks mention of specific defensive tools (e.g., email security gateways, DMARC/SPF/DKIM) or techniques beyond MFA, which are expected for 'industry-specific' content and specific tool mentions.
